Found incumbent of value 4,000000 after 0,00 sec. (0,00 ticks)
Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 2 rows and 4 columns.
Aggregator did 4 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0,00 sec. (0,01 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0,00 sec. (0,01 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 28 threads:
  Real time             =    0,00 sec. (0,00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0,00 sec. (0,01 ticks)
